## Update package lists:
* `sudo apt-get update`

## Upgrade packages:

## Optionally, upgrade the distribution:

# Considerations
* **Security Risks**: Regular updates are crucial for security. Disabling automatic updates means you need to be diligent about manually updating your system to protect against vulnerabilities.
* **Update Frequency**: Decide on a regular schedule for manual updates to ensure your system doesn't fall behind on critical security patches.
* **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on Ubuntu security bulletins or subscribe to mailing lists to stay informed about important updates.
* **Convenience vs. Control**: Automatic updates offer convenience and security, but manual updates provide more control over when and what gets updated, which can be important in certain environments.
